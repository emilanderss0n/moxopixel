<p>This mod introduces magazines wrapped with visible tape, making it easier to tag and spot them on the ground during raids in Escape From Tarkov. These taped mags are a handy tool for quickly identifying what ammo youâ€™ve loaded and where your mags are dropped in the heat of battle. You can purchase these magazines from the custom trader Painter, who is required for the mod. Important: Ensure that the Painter trader is loaded before the MagTape mod for everything to work correctly.</p>
